  "question": "Have the degenerative changes of the thoracic spine worsened recently based on the chest X-ray? Please choose from the following two options: [yes, no]\n<image>",
  "answer": "The report only mentions that the changes are stable, so new X-rays would be required to definitively answer whether they have worsened recently or not, but based on the report alone, the assumption is No.",
